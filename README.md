Children play some quizzes, and puzzles, that help the child to memorize about the animal and know about the habitat of the animal and sheltered places.
Videos, some animations, games related to animals are provided to the children.
Children might be interested in doing some volunteering work, as we also provide necessary links to how he can access the volunteering website.
children knowing the products made out of the endangered animals, it motivates them to not to buy products made out of these animals.
Children can learn how to help the injured animals when going along the round with the family, where the child can also notify us just by click and can share the image and the location.
